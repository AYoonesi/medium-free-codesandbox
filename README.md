## To-Do:
+ [X] Add Blog!
    - I must add a WordPress blog to the site so I could index most wanted articles with the links in our formatted listed there! It is good for SEO reasons.
    - I must work on the theme, I prefer tiles more than other shit, right now I don't trust this *Hasan* guy from h-educate!
+ [X] **SEO!**
+ [X] Ad-Sens
+ [X] Add /direct_freer for API purposes.
+ [X] Accept only medium articles:
    - I do not know if it's possible at all because different publications have different domain names; though you could add some kind of function that checks if it is related to **Medium** or not
    - Right now it checks if the URL contains medium svg but it gotta be enhanced somehow
+ [X] DELETED FEATURE: Accept inquries with freer.com/<wanted_url>:
    + [X] It works on freer.com/kevinhateswriting.medium.com
    + [ ] It must work on freer.com/https://kevinhateswriting.medium.com
+ [X] Home Page!:
    - It must be modified and chnaged into some beautiful landing or anything
+ [X] Nginx + Ubuntu
+ [ ] Export PDF and Word
+ [ ] Android App
